First, I will load all the packages I will need for this homework
assignment: tidyverse.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

First, I will load the Instacart data set.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Now, I will create a data frame for the Instacart data set.

``` r
instacart_df =
  p8105.datasets::instacart
```

The Instacart data set contains 15 variables and 1384617 observations.

The Instacart dataset contains 134 aisles. The aisle most frequently
ordered from is aisle 83, otherwise known as fresh vegetables.

Now, I will make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle for aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
instacart_df_plot =
  instacart_df |>
  group_by(aisle_id) |>
  summarize(count = n_distinct(product_name))
```

Now, I will make a table showing the three most popular items in 3
aisles.

Now, I will make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which two
items were ordered on each day of the week.

# Problem 2

First, I will load the BRFSS dataset.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Now, I will create a data frame for the data set and do some data
cleaning.

``` r
brffs_df =
  p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010
```

# Problem 3
