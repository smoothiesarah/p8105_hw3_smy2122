As always, I will begin by loading all the packages I will need for this
homework assignment: tidyverse, ggridges, and p8105.datasets.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

# Problem 1

First, I will load the Instacart data set.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart_df =
  instacart |>
  as_tibble()
```

The Instacart data set contains 15 variables and 1384617 observations.
There are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct
users.

Furthermore, there are 134 aisles. The aisle most frequently ordered
from is aisle 83, otherwise known as fresh vegetables. According to the
code below, the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles had the most
products.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  count(aisle) |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Below is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle for
aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  count(aisle) |>
  filter(n > 10000) |>
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n, color = aisle)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  labs(caption = "Among aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered")
```

Now, I will make a table showing the top 3 most popular items in 3
aisles (baking ingredients, dog food care, and packaged vegetables
fruits) and the number of times each item was ordered.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  filter(
    aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")
  ) |>
  select(aisle, product_name, order_id) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                    |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            | 3324 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                             | 1920 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                             | 1692 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |  157 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                                |  140 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Organic Vanilla Extract                         |  122 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |   14 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe             |   13 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Original Dry Dog                                |    9 |    3 |

Now, I will make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which two
items were ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| product_name     |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

# Problem 2

First, I will load the BRFSS dataset.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Now, I will create a data frame for the data set and do some data
cleaning: formatting the data to use appropriate variable names,
filtering the data set to focus on the “Overall Health” topic, and
organizing responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent.”

``` r
brffs_df =
  p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = 5) |>
  select(everything(), -state) |>
  rename(state = locationabbr) |>
  filter(
    topic == "Overall Health",
    response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) |>
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))) |>
  select(year, state, county, topic, response, data_value)
```

The tables below show the states that were observed at 7 or more
locations in 2002 and 2010.

``` r
brffs_df |>
  select(year, state, county) |>
  filter(year == 2002) |>
  distinct() |>
  group_by(state, year) |>
  summarize(n = n()) |>
  filter(n >= 7) |>
  arrange(year, desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | year |   n |
|:------|-----:|----:|
| PA    | 2002 |  10 |
| MA    | 2002 |   8 |
| NJ    | 2002 |   8 |
| CT    | 2002 |   7 |
| FL    | 2002 |   7 |
| NC    | 2002 |   7 |

``` r
brffs_df |>
  select(year, state, county) |>
  filter(year == 2010) |>
  distinct() |>
  group_by(state, year) |>
  summarize(n = n()) |>
  filter(n >= 7) |>
  arrange(year, desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | year |   n |
|:------|-----:|----:|
| FL    | 2010 |  41 |
| NJ    | 2010 |  19 |
| TX    | 2010 |  16 |

| CO    | 2010 |   7 |
| PA    | 2010 |   7 |
| SC    | 2010 |   7 |

Below is a spaghetti plot showing the average value over time for each
state from 2002 to 2010. Overall, the plot shows a slight decrease in
mean value over time across most states despite immense variation across
state and year.

``` r
brffs_df |>
  filter(response == "Excellent") |>
  group_by(year, state) |>
  summarize(mean_data_value = mean(data_value)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, group = state, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mean value",
    color = "State",
    title = "The average data value over time for each state from 2002 to 2010")
```

Below is a two-panel plot showing the distribution of data value for
responses among locations in New York State in 2006 and 2010. The plot
shows that data values were highest for “Very good” and “Good” responses
in both 2006 and 2010.

``` r
brffs_df |>
  filter(
    year == c(2006, 2010),
    state == "NY") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +

    x = "Response",
    y = "Data value",
    color = "Location",
    title = "Distribution of data values for responses among locations in New York State in 2006 and 2010"
  )

# Problem 3

First, I will import, clean, and tidy the two data sets. As part of data
cleaning for the demographics data set, I will remove the unnecessary
rows, set missing values, clean variable names, exclude participants
under age 21, drop those with missing demographic data, encode sex and
education as factors, and re-level education. Data cleaning for the
accelerometer data set only needs cleaning variable names, as there are
no unnecessary rows and no missing values.

``` r
demographic_df =
  read_csv(
    "./data/nhanes_covar.csv",
    skip = 4,
    na = "NA") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  filter(age >= 21) |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(
    sex =
      case_match(
        sex,
        1 ~ "male",
        2 ~ "female"),
        sex = as.factor(sex)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    education =
      case_match(
        education,
        1 ~ "less than high school",
        2 ~ "high school equivalent",
        3 ~ "more than high school"),
    education = as.factor(education)
  ) |>
  mutate(education = fct_relevel(education, c("less than high school", "high school equivalent", "more than high school")))

accelerometer_df =
  read_csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Now, I will merge the two data sets using an inner join to only show
participants in both data sets.

``` r
merged_df =
  inner_join(demographic_df, accelerometer_df)
```

Below is a table of the number of men and women in each education
category.

``` r
merged_df |>
  count(sex, education) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "education",
    values_from = n
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex    | less than high school | high school equivalent | more than high school |
|:-------|----------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|
| female |                    28 |                     23 |                    59 |
| male   |                    27 |                     35 |                    56 |

Below is a box plot of the age distributions for men and women in each
education category. The box plot shows that

``` r
merged_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(
    x = "Sex",
    y = "Age",
    title = "Age distribution among men and women in each education category"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw3_smy2122_files/figure-gfm/age%20distribution%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

Below is a three-panel plot of total activity over the day for men and
women of each education level. The plot shows that total physical
activity decreases most sharply for men and women with less than a high
school education and least sharply for men and women with more than a
high school education. Among men and women with a high school education
or equivalent, total physical activity sharply dropped between ages
60-63 but then sharply increased around ages 70-34, and a similar
(although less strong) trend occurred for men but not women with more
than a high school education. By age 80, females with more than a high
school education had the highest total physical activity.

``` r
merged_df |>
  group_by(seqn) |>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) |>
  mutate(total_activity = sum(activity)) |>
  select(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education, total_activity) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ education) +
  labs(
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total physical activity over the day (measured by MIMS)",
    title = "Comparison of the total physical activity over the day for men and women of each education level"
  )
```

Below is a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each education level. The plot shows that, for those with less than
a high school education or with a high school education or equivalent,
physical activity is highest on average in the early afternoon before
noon, whereas for those with more than a high school education, physical
activity peaks twice: right before noon and in the evening. (This trend
may reflect the possibility that men and women with more than a high
school education may be more likely to work traditional 9am to 5pm
corporate-style jobs.) Physical activity for women of all education
levels seems highest before noon whereas physical activity for men of
all education levels seems highest in the evening.

  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minute",
