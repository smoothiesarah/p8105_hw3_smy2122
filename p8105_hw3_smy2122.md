First, I will load all the packages I will need for this homework
assignment: tidyverse.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

First, I will load the Instacart data set.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Now, I will create a data frame for the Instacart data set.

``` r
instacart_df =
  p8105.datasets::instacart
```

The Instacart data set contains 15 variables and 1384617 observations.

The Instacart dataset contains 134 aisles. The aisle most frequently
ordered from is aisle 83, otherwise known as fresh vegetables.

Now, I will make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle for aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(count = n_distinct(product_name))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                  count
    ##    <chr>                  <int>
    ##  1 air fresheners candles   234
    ##  2 asian foods              495
    ##  3 baby accessories          22
    ##  4 baby bath body care       90
    ##  5 baby food formula        606
    ##  6 bakery desserts          216
    ##  7 baking ingredients       523
    ##  8 baking supplies decor    185
    ##  9 beauty                    88
    ## 10 beers coolers            225
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Now, I will make a table showing the three most popular items in 3
aisles and the number of times each item was ordered.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  filter(
    aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")
  ) |>
  select(aisle, product_name, order_id)
```

    ## # A tibble: 31,339 × 3
    ##    aisle                      product_name                      order_id
    ##    <chr>                      <chr>                                <int>
    ##  1 packaged vegetables fruits Super Greens Salad                      36
    ##  2 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Biologique Limes                38
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Raspberries                     96
    ##  4 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Raspberries                     98
    ##  5 baking ingredients         Organic Corn Starch                     98
    ##  6 packaged vegetables fruits Asian Chopped Salad with Dressing      170
    ##  7 packaged vegetables fruits BBQ Ranch Chopped Salad                170
    ##  8 packaged vegetables fruits Baby Spinach                           170
    ##  9 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Blueberries                    226
    ## 10 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Shredded Carrots               844
    ## # ℹ 31,329 more rows

Now, I will make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which two
items were ordered on each day of the week.

# Problem 2

First, I will load the BRFSS dataset.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Now, I will create a data frame for the data set and do some data
cleaning.

``` r
brffs_df =
  p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  rename(location_abbr = locationabbr) |>
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = 5) |>
  select(everything(), -state) |>
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |>
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

# Problem 3
